# Open Source @ Kienle Holdings

ðŸ§¡ Open Source Apps and Packages from Kienle Holdings

## Big Changes Are Coming

We're super pumped to be finishing up Zephyr 4.0 very soon here! Unfortunately that means you're
gonna see some weird looking things in this repo for the forseeable future. Some of those changes
include:

- Automatic package publishing is disabled
- We won't really be looking at any Zephyr related PRs
- Some stuff might get pushed to main that looks like it shouldn't be (as we move our OSS
  documentation infrastructure from AWS to Vercel)

With that in mind, enjoy! Don't be afraid to open up a discussion of things look really wacky.
